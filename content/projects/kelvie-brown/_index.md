Online information and showcase site, by PilotBean.

Working as part of a 3-strong dev team, I led the front end development for the responsive site.

The site front end is built on jQuery and Modernizr, and uses various libraries such as jQuery UI and jQuery Mouse Wheel. The back end is a custom CMS build with .net.
