I was asked by Rob Tucker to redesign his existing online photography portfolio to showcase his work in a clean and simple layout.

I was wholly responsible for the design, UX, content migration and front and back end builds for the responsive site.

The site is built on the HTML5 boilerplate using LESS. Site assets comiled using CodeKit. The front end uses various jQuery plugins - Isotope, Fancybox and WaitForImages. The site uses CSS3 animations.

Fonts are News Cycle served by Google Fonts.

CMS is WordPress, extended with various custom scripts and plugins, most notably NextGen Gallery.
