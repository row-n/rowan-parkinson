I was approached by [Elevator App Development](http://elevatorappdevelopment.com/) to create a site which showcases *The Insider*, a fresh new app they had created.

Working closely with the team we came up with the design and UX. I was responsible front and back end builds.

The site is built on the HTML5 boilerplate. The front end uses various jQuery plugins - Modernizr, Cycle, PageScroll and Easing animation library. It's built as a single page with anchor points throughout the page.

Fonts are Asap and Comfortaa served by Google Fonts.
