Rory is a friend whom I have known for a few years now, so when he approached me with the idea of creating a site to showcase his latest hobby in the form of wood sculptures I jumped at the chance. Rory had a exhibition approaching which let to a short deadline.

I undertook the entire site from end to end, including design, developing and organising hosting.

The site is built with Hugo static site generator and hosted using Forestry.io. Site assets compiled using Gulp and Browserify. The front end uses various jQuery plugins - Blazy and Sticky-JS. The site uses CSS3 animations.

Fonts are Work Sans served by Google Fonts.
